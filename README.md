# Jacob Kennedy - Research & Reflection

## Course goals

<!-- Context 1 -->
Over the time in this course, I want to take actionable steps to become a stronger programmer and more in tune and efficient with what I do when developing. I often write code and create programs and find myself kicking myself when I see others do the same tasks so much more efficiently than I. I want to work towards having a deep understanding of the effects of what I'm doing when writing programs and how I interact with the machine I work on. 

<!-- Goal 1 -->
I'm going to spend time on coding websites and online communites challenging myself to write more complex and meaningful code on a daily basis. I want to spend at least 8 hours a week focusing specifically on programming in Java. 

<!-- Goal 2 -->
In the theme of 104 being a app development course, I'd like to increase my knowledge of mobile platforms and learn some useful practices for efficient coding on mobile platforms. I'm going to research people and teams who have experience in the field of mobile development and study/learn from them using resources like youtube.

<!-- Context 2 -->
Over the duration of this course, I'd like to be able to envision ways to elevate my coding and challenge myself to do things that I'm maybe uncomfortable with. For example, trying new coding techniques or concepts. I'm not sure what that looks like or how to articulate it at this moment but the next time I visit this I want to be able to identify areas in my skillset to expand on.

I feel I gave the model/view/adapter assignment an honest attempt, but am struggling. Hopefully
a 1-on-1 in class will help.

### Week 6
Some design patterns I found interesting are the factory method, builder and decorator. I feel learning and understanding these concepts can help me in my courses and better progress my knowledge of coding in general.

>Identify and explain in your Research & Reflection journal at least two positives (things you've seen we should do) and two negatives (things you've seen we shouldn't do) in terms of documentation approach that you've seen in any two of the following design pattern repositories:

Is this in regards to our community code assignment? I really like the use of code blocks and photos to help simplify explanation of concepts and how (some) of the repositories are neatly filed and laid out. 

### Week 8

Something I think could be interesting to pursue or perhaps branch off of is some sort of arcade-game style app. I feel it may be a bit optimistic, but I could use my basic tic-tac-toe or poker games I made while in the early stages of learning Python to use as a starting point. These games are pretty messy but could have potential. I'm not married to this idea, but it may be a good challenge for me to finish this course strong as it started off somewhat poorly. I also don't want to bite off to much as I have large projects in cps101 and cps128 as well.

It's going to take some time to adjust to app inventor and the block system. I am somewhat satisfied with the UI of the map it app, perhaps if were looking for improvements I could think about adding some categorization to the locations (house, landmark, business etc), I would also consider exploring embedding a map into the app rather than opening an external application.

As a user of mapit I would be looking for some sort of selling point for this app. What woos me to using mapit that elevates it over the use of a normal maps app? Perhaps it could be geared as a travel companion, based on my use habits, if I were in a new spot, would the app suggest some new things to do or see? What if there was a social aspect to it? Facebook/Instagram/Twitter implementation to seamlessly and efforlessly turn my journey into a blog of sorts?

**Suggestion function proposal "pseudocode"**

> Suggestion function: Based on user input (Location) -> examine data from database/internet of previous visitors and compare against other locations visited by those people -> Suggest highly rated/reviewed businesses/landmarks by mutual users to user

This may be challenging from a development/rollout angle as it likely would require a developed clientele to work as intended.

>Examine the code blocks in the completed app with a critical eye. How could the code blocks be improved, based on what youâ€™ve learned about good programming practice?

The point I'd like to make regarding this question is less about the code itself, but more from a structure standpoint. I wonder if there is a way this program could be structured better. To elaborate: I find this code very hard to deal with from a visual and hierarchical view. The block system is nice in that a lot of the heavy lifting is already done, but for me, I feel this comes at a cost that I didn't have to think through the development process as much,so looking back and understanding what I've already done is somewhat challenging. This could be from a lack of experience/practice on my part, and that's on me.
