# Jacob Kennedy - Research & Reflection

## Course goals

<!-- Context 1 -->
Over the time in this course, I want to take actionable steps to become a stronger programmer and more in tune and efficient with what I do when developing. I often write code and create programs and find myself kicking myself when I see others do the same tasks so much more efficiently than I. I want to work towards having a deep understanding of the effects of what I'm doing when writing programs and how I interact with the machine I work on. 

<!-- Goal 1 -->
I'm going to spend time on coding websites and online communites challenging myself to write more complex and meaningful code on a daily basis. I want to spend at least 8 hours a week focusing specifically on programming in Java. 

<!-- Goal 2 -->
In the theme of 104 being a app development course, I'd like to increase my knowledge of mobile platforms and learn some useful practices for efficient coding on mobile platforms. I'm going to research people and teams who have experience in the field of mobile development and study/learn from them using resources like youtube.

<!-- Context 2 -->
Over the duration of this course, I'd like to be able to envision ways to elevate my coding and challenge myself to do things that I'm maybe uncomfortable with. For example, trying new coding techniques or concepts. I'm not sure what that looks like or how to articulate it at this moment but the next time I visit this I want to be able to identify areas in my skillset to expand on.

### Some potential community starting points
The following repositories were found through various GitHub searches (through the [Java topics](https://github.com/topics/java), as well as using the [Advanced Search](https://github.com/search/advanced) tool to identify Java-based repositories with a certain minimum number of stars, forks, or recent contributions). I used search terms related to our discussion yesterday, including "math", "algorithms", "statistics", and "data analysis".

Each repository (listed not in any particular order) comes with a bit of my personal analysis, that might help get you started:

| Repo | About | Contributions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Symja Android Library](https://github.com/axkr/symja_android_library) | A symbolic math system for the [NCalc calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duy.calculator.free) app on Google Play (basically a highly advanced scientific and engineering calculator) | This one is pretty complex, but if you want a real challenge it's a possible route. They have issues with a `help wanted` tag and [contibution guidelines](https://github.com/axkr/symja_android_library/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| [Hactoberfest Mathematics](https://github.com/BaReinhard/Hacktoberfest-Mathematics) | Basically includes a bunch of scripts and patterns for mathematical use in code | NO LONGER ACTIVE - but you could consider forking it and making some changes / improvements | 
| [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/thepranaygupta/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms) | Pretty much what it sounds like - there are Java and C++ implementations | Not too active, but there are a few open issues that you could look at to get a sense of what people hoped to accomplish, or you can look at it in the context of what you're learning in CPS 101 and perhaps aim to add to the repo |
| [Java Design Patterns](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns) | Contains a very thorough list of many design pattern implementations | This one is more active and accepts contributions, but it might be a bit out of reach for you right now (they anticipate more advanced Java knowledge). However, they do have quite a few `help wanted` and some `good first issue` tagged issues, so again a good place to look for understanding needs |
| [The Algorithms - Java](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java) | Relatively active collection of commonly used algorithms | [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are pretty light-weight, but they do have a [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community?source=orgpage#) where the community discusses issues. It's quite a large community too, with over 450 contributors (though, of course, not all recently) |
| [leetcode](https://github.com/doocs/leetcode) | Not an official leetcode repository, but rather a repository with solutions to many leetcode problems. [English version of README here](https://github.com/doocs/leetcode/blob/main/README_EN.md) | I think this is primarily maintained by a single individual, but you could consider forking this repository and creating new solutions to problems yourself. You could then open a pull request to share the code with the main, if you like, or just keep it for yourself |
