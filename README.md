# Jacob Kennedy - Research & Reflection

## Course goals

<!-- Context 1 -->
Over the time in this course, I want to take actionable steps to become a stronger programmer and more in tune and efficient with what I do when developing. I often write code and create programs and find myself kicking myself when I see others do the same tasks so much more efficiently than I. I want to work towards having a deep understanding of the effects of what I'm doing when writing programs and how I interact with the machine I work on. 

<!-- Goal 1 -->
I'm going to spend time on coding websites and online communites challenging myself to write more complex and meaningful code on a daily basis. I want to spend at least 8 hours a week focusing specifically on programming in Java. 

<!-- Goal 2 -->
In the theme of 104 being a app development course, I'd like to increase my knowledge of mobile platforms and learn some useful practices for efficient coding on mobile platforms. I'm going to research people and teams who have experience in the field of mobile development and study/learn from them using resources like youtube.

<!-- Context 2 -->
Over the duration of this course, I'd like to be able to envision ways to elevate my coding and challenge myself to do things that I'm maybe uncomfortable with. For example, trying new coding techniques or concepts. I'm not sure what that looks like or how to articulate it at this moment but the next time I visit this I want to be able to identify areas in my skillset to expand on.

I feel I gave the model/view/adapter assignment an honest attempt, but am struggling. Hopefully
a 1-on-1 in class will help.

### Week 6
Some design patterns I found interesting are the factory method, builder and decorator. I feel learning and understanding these concepts can help me in my courses and better progress my knowledge of coding in general.

>Identify and explain in your Research & Reflection journal at least two positives (things you've seen we should do) and two negatives (things you've seen we shouldn't do) in terms of documentation approach that you've seen in any two of the following design pattern repositories:

Is this in regards to our community code assignment? I really like the use of code blocks and photos to help simplify explanation of concepts and how (some) of the repositories are neatly filed and laid out.
